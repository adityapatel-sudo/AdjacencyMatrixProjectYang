    "**Graph** - A graph is a set of **Vertices** connected by **Edges**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjacency Matrix** - a way of depicting a graph in the form of a matrix. An adjacency matrix depicting a graph with n vertices will be an $ n\\times n $ matrix.\n",
    "The entry $(n,m)$ in the matrix will be $1$ if vertices $ n $ and $ m $ are connected by an edge, and $0$ if not.\n",

    "This matrix has 6 vertices, various edges wherever $(n,m)$ is equal to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix like this can be used to depict an airline system, with each vertex being an airport and edges being flights between airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses of Adjacency Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency matrices can help us answer questions such as, \"How many airports can I go to in two flights?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to connect two airports in two flights, there must be a common layover. We can calculate this using the matrix by seeing which vertices have common edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use Figure 1 as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $(m,n) = M_{mn}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{21}M_{16}+M_{22}M_{26}+M_{23}M_{36}+M_{24}M_{46}+M_{25}M_{56}+M_{26}M_{66}$$ =\n",
    "$$ 1 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 1 = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to see that there are 2 paths from vertex m to vertex n when we have an intermediate vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above equation, it's clear that the number of two-step sequences between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ in an graph with adjacency matrix M is the $(i,j)$ entry in $M^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following is given from the project:\n",
    "The number of $k$-step sequences between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ in a graph\n",
    "with adjacency matrix $M$ is the $(i,j)$ entry in $M^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "if M is the adjacency matrix for Figure 1,\n",
    "\n",
    "$M^2 =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2\\\\\n",
    "1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 1\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
    "1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 1\\\\\n",
    "0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 3\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to easily see the number of 2-step flights from any vertex to any other. Calculating $M^3$ and so on will allow us to see the 3-step and longer paths from vertex to vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to know the least number of flights to go from one airport to another, we can simply calculate $M^2,M^3,M4...$ until the $(m,n)$ has one or more paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Connected\n",
    "Another commonly asked question is whether it is possible to go from any vertex to any other vertex. We can solve this by calculating $S_k = M^1+M^2+M^3...M^n$, where n is the total number of vertices. This matrix will show the total number of paths from any vertex to any other vertex. There are likely exponentially more paths from one matrix to another in a matrix of n size.\n"
